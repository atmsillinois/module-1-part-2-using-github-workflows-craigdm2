# Favorite/Least Favorite Number Ratio

This script allows you to enter your favorite and least favorite number and compute the ratio.

## How does it work?

It divides the user's favorite number by their least favorite number. Truly complex stuff. There's a check if the user's least favorite number is 0 to avoid div/0 errors.
